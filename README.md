# Local Help SD

### Summary

The vision for this project is to be a place where people who have been affected by COVID-19 can be connected
with members of the community who want to volunteer to help in some way. Those who want to help will be able
to select areas where they can help which will match them with members who need help in those specific areas.
Those who need help will be able to share their stories to help volunteers to relate and empathize with people
on a more individual basis than might be experienced in a broader volunteer experience.
